A collection of interviews with creative people about what
hardware and software they use.

Basically the Norwegian version of
[The Setup](http://usesthis.com), made with the blessing of its creator - [Daniel Bogan](http://github.com/waferbaby).

# Running it locally

The rig needs node v18 or higher when I write this. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a good way to install different node versions.

`npm install ` to install dependencies

`npm run dev` to launch site locally at localhost:4321: web pages will auto-reload if you save any changes while you have that running.

`./new-interview.rb` from root dir to generate scaffolding for each new interview


# Editing interviews

The interview content is found under `src/content/blog/`

# Deploying it

Push to master, Github Actions will deploy the site to Github Pages (see `astro.yml`)


_The rest of the README is bits and pieces from the default Astro README_

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
